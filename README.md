# Quantified Self

## What is Quantified Self ?

The quantified self is the use of self-measurement tools and technologies with the aim of improving one's self knowledge. Data can be acquired through several means including:
- Smart watches
- Sleep trackers
- Fitness apps
- Mood trackers
- HR monitors

For a more detailed introduction to quantified self, you can check the following sources:

## Why am I doing this?
This project has multiple goals:
- Experiment quantified self.
- Reclaim ownership of my personal data.
- Develop skills in cloud technologies (GCP) and web apps (streamlit).
